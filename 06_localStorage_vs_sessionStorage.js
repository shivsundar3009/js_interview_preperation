Certainly! The difference between local storage and session storage is a common topic in web development interviews. Here's a concise explanation that you can use to answer such a question:

Local Storage:

Persistence: Data stored in local storage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
Scope: Local storage has a larger scope and is accessible across browser tabs and windows for the same origin (same protocol, host, and port).
Storage Limit: Local storage typically has a larger storage limit compared to session storage (usually around 5 MB per domain).

Session Storage:

Persistence: Data stored in session storage is only available for the duration of the page session. It is cleared when the tab or window is closed.
Scope: Session storage is limited to the particular tab or window. It is not accessible across different tabs or windows, even if they belong to the same origin.
Storage Limit: Session storage usually has a smaller storage limit compared to local storage. It's typically around 5 MB per domain, similar to local storage.
In summary, local storage is suitable for storing data that needs to persist across sessions and is accessible across tabs and windows, while session storage is
  more appropriate for temporary data that should be available only within the same tab or window session.
