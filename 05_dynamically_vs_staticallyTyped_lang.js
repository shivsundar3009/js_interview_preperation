JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. The terms "dynamic typing" and "static typing" 
  refer to how the type of a variable is handled in a programming language.

1 Dynamically Typed Languages:

In dynamically typed languages, variable types are resolved at runtime. This means that you 
  don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you define it.
  The type of a variable can change during the execution of the program.

JavaScript is an example of a dynamically typed language. For instance, you can use the same 
  variable to store different types of data without explicitly specifying the type:

let x = 10;      // x is a number
x = "Hello";     // x is now a string
x = [1, 2, 3];    // x is now an array


2 Statically Typed Languages:

In statically typed languages, variable types are checked at compile-time. This means that you 
  must declare the data type of a variable when you define it, and that type remains fixed
    throughout the program's execution.

Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C++, and Swift. Here's an example in Java:

int x = 10;        // x is an integer
// x = "Hello";    // Error: incompatible types, you can't assign a string to an int


In summary:

Dynamic typing allows for flexibility, as variable types can change during runtime.
Static typing provides more predictability and catches type-related errors early in the
  development process.
    
JavaScript's dynamic typing can be both an advantage and a source of potential issues,
    as it offers flexibility but may lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully.
    It's essential for developers to be aware of the dynamic nature of JavaScript when 
    writing code to avoid unintended consequences.
