In JavaScript, primitive data types are basic data types that are not objects and do not have methods. There are six primitive data types in JavaScript:

1. String: Represents a sequence of characters. It is used for textual data.
let myString = "Hello, World!";

2. Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
let myNumber = 42;

3. Boolean: Represents a logical entity and can have only two values: true or false.
let myBoolean = true;

4. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
let myUndefined;

5. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
let myNull = null;

6. Symbol: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), symbols are unique and immutable data types, often used as keys in objects.
let mySymbol = Symbol("description");

These primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. Additionally, 
when you perform operations on primitive data types, they are treated as values rather than objects. For example, strings, numbers, and booleans are passed by value.
