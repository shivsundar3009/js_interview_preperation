Asynchronous and synchronous are terms used to describe the way in which tasks are executed in a programming language, 
and they are often discussed in the context of JavaScript.

1. Synchronous JavaScript:

In synchronous code, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other.
  
Each task must complete before the next one starts.
  
If a task takes time to complete, the entire program will be blocked, and nothing else can happen during that time.
  
Synchronous code can be more straightforward to read and write, as the flow of execution is linear and predictable.

console.log('Task 1');
console.log('Task 2');
console.log('Task 3');

2. Asynchronous JavaScript:

In asynchronous code, tasks are initiated, but the program doesn't wait for them to complete. Instead, it continues with other tasks.
  
Asynchronous operations are typically used for tasks that might take some time, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file.
  
Callbacks, Promises, and async/await are common mechanisms for handling asynchronous code in JavaScript.

### using callback

  console.log('Task 1');

setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('Task 2');
}, 1000);

console.log('Task 3');

### using Promise

console.log('Task 1');

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log('Task 2');
        resolve();
    }, 1000);
}).then(function() {
    console.log('Task 3');
});

### using async Await

  async function example() {
    console.log('Task 1');

    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

    console.log('Task 2');
}

example();
console.log('Task 3');

Asynchronous code is crucial in scenarios where you want to avoid blocking the main thread, 
  
especially in web development when dealing with tasks like making API calls or handling user 

interactions without freezing the UI. It allows for more responsive and efficient applications.
